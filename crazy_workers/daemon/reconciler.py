  Crash detection is split from the restart on purpose. A worker that dies the
  instant it starts comes back from ``start_worker`` marked RUNNING; if the same
  pass that noticed the dead PID respawned it, its status would flip to RUNNING
  again before the backoff branch ever saw CRASHED, and an instantly-crashing
  worker would respawn at full loop speed forever. Instead the first pass records
  the death (CRASHED + a bumped restart_count), and a later pass restarts it once
  the exponential backoff has elapsed.
