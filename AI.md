# AI Project Context & Rules

## Core Mandates

- **Clean & Talking Code**: Prioritize expressive, self-documenting code. Variables, functions, and classes should have clear, descriptive names that reveal their intent.
- **Modularity & Decomposition**: Keep files small and focused on a single responsibility. If a file becomes too large or complex, refactor it into a module (a directory with `__init__.py` and sub-modules).
- **Structured Testing**: Tests must be organized into a `tests/` directory that mirrors the package structure. Each source module should have a corresponding test module. Cross-cutting integration tests go in `tests/integration/`. Tests for `example_app/` go in `tests/app/`.
- **Responsibility Distribution**: Aim for a balanced distribution of responsibilities. Use design patterns where appropriate to reduce complexity.
- **Testing Integrity**: Never modify the codebase solely to facilitate a test. If a test is difficult to write, refactor for better observability or improve the test setup.
- **Linting & Formatting**: Always run `ruff check . --fix` and `ruff format .` after any code change.
- **Testing**: Always run `pytest` after changes.
- **Coverage**: Ensure total coverage stays above 95%. New code must be covered by tests. Each individual file must maintain a minimum coverage of 75%.
- **Clean Tests**: Tests must be clean, readable, and strictly free of `print()` statements. Use assertions for verification.
- **No Silent Exceptions**: Avoid broad `except Exception: pass` blocks. Catch only specific, expected exception types. Each exception handler must either log the error, propagate it, or have an explicit comment explaining why silence is correct.
- **Documentation Maintenance**: After every development cycle, review and update `README.md`, `CLI.md`, and this file. Ensure all functional changes, new configurations, and architectural shifts are accurately reflected.
- **Style**: Follow `pyproject.toml` (2-space indent, single quotes). No `print` statements. Imports must be sorted alphabetically and organized into two blocks separated by a blank line:
  1. External dependencies: standard library and third-party packages.
  2. Project-internal imports: modules belonging to the project itself.
